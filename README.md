# Airbnb Recommendation System for Kenya

---

## Overview

This project presents a recommendation system tailored specifically for Airbnb listings in Kenya. Leveraging Python for data preprocessing and model training, Flask for backend development, and HTML along with Tailwind CSS for frontend development, this system offers personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and previous interactions. The recommendation algorithm is powered by Scikit-learn and utilizes cosine similarity to find similar listings.

## Backend

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Used for data preprocessing and model training.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework used to connect the backend with the frontend.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database management system used for storing listing data.

### Development Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered Airbnb listing data specific to Kenya.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed the data to extract relevant features.
3. **Model Training**: Trained the recommendation algorithm using Scikit-learn, focusing on cosine similarity for measuring listing similarities.
4. **Backend Development**: Developed backend functionalities using Flask to handle user requests and interact with the recommendation model.
5. **Database Setup**: Utilized PostgreSQL to store listing data for efficient retrieval and management.

### Usage

To use the backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Set up the PostgreSQL database and import the Airbnb listing data.
3. Install the necessary Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.

## Frontend

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the frontend user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the frontend components.

### Development Process

1. **UI Design**: Designed the user interface using HTML and Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience.
2. **Integration**: Connected the frontend with the backend to provide users with personalized recommendations.

### Usage

To use the frontend, access the application through your web browser after setting up and running the backend.

## Machine Learning Model

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Used for data preprocessing and model training.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for exploratory data analysis, model prototyping, and documentation.
- **Scikit-learn**: An efficient machine learning library used for implementing the recommendation algorithm and cosine similarity calculations.

### Development Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered Airbnb listing data specific to Kenya.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed the data to extract relevant features.
3. **Model Training**: Trained the recommendation algorithm using Scikit-learn, focusing on cosine similarity for measuring listing similarities.

### Usage

The machine learning model is utilized by the backend to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and previous interactions.
